                                                NOT REGEXP '^[AEIOUaeiou]': This condition checks that the city name does not start with a vowel.

Explanation:

                                                [^AEIOUaeiou]: This is a negated character set that matches any character that is not a vowel (both uppercase and lowercase).
                                                So, REGEXP '^[^AEIOUaeiou]' checks if the city name starts with a consonant (or any non-vowel character).

                                                      This function extracts the first character of the city name.
                                                      lower(...):
                                                      This converts the extracted character to lowercase to ensure a case-insensitive comparison.
                                                      NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'):
                                                      This condition checks if the first character is not one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
                                                      This part ensures that the city name does not start with a vowel.

                                                      This function extracts the last character of the city name. The negative index -1 specifies that it should take the last character.

                                                ^: Anchors the match to the start of the string.
                                                [^AEIOUaeiou]: This is a negated character set that matches any character that is not a vowel (both uppercase and lowercase).
                                                .*: This matches any sequence of characters (zero or more) in between.
                                                [^AEIOUaeiou]$: This matches any character that is not a vowel at the end of the string.
                                                Together, this means the string must start with a consonant and end with a consonant.
