Weather_Observation_Station_10
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

########## Solution MYSQL :   (I)
                                SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                                FROM station
                                WHERE CITY not REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$';

SELECT DISTINCT(city): This selects unique city names from the station table.

WHERE CITY NOT REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$': This part applies a condition to filter city names. Here's how it works:

REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$': This regular expression checks if the city name ends with a vowel ($ denotes the end of a string). The pattern [aeiouAEIOU] matches any vowel (both lowercase and uppercase).
NOT REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$': The NOT keyword negates the regular expression match, meaning it selects cities whose names do not end with a vowel.

                                  (II)
                                      SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                                      FROM station
                                      WHERE CITY  REGEXP '[^aeiouAEIOU]$';
 the REGEXP '[^aeiouAEIOU]$' pattern ensures that only city names whose last character is not a vowel (i.e., ends with a consonant or other non-vowel characters) are selected.

########## Solution Oracle:  
                                          SELECT distinct(city)
                                          FROM station
                                          WHERE SUBSTR(city,-1,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

SELECT DISTINCT(city): This selects unique (distinct) city names from the station table.

SUBSTR(city, -1, 1):

SUBSTR() is a function used to extract a substring from a string.
In this case, city is the string (city name), -1 is the starting position from the end of the string (negative index), and 1 specifies that only 1 character will be extracted.
So, SUBSTR(city, -1, 1) extracts the last character of the city's name.
NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u'):

This checks if the extracted last character is not one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
Since the function checks for lowercase vowels, the query only filters cities whose names do not end with a lowercase vowel.
