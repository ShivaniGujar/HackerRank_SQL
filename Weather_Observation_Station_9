Weather_Observation_Station_9

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

#### Solution 1 MYSQL:
                 (I)  SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                      FROM station
                      WHERE city NOT REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU]';

                        ^[aeiouAEIOU]: This regular expression checks if the city name starts with a vowel (lowercase or uppercase).
                        NOT REGEXP: Ensures that cities whose names do not start with any vowel are selected.

                (II)  SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                      FROM station
                      WHERE city  REGEXP '^[^aeiouAEIOU]';

                      ^[^aeiouAEIOU]: This regular expression matches city names that start with any character except vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).

#### Solution 2 Oracle: 

                        SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                        FROM station
                        WHERE  LOWER(SUBSTR(city,1,1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
