########### Concept USed:  REGEXP ^ for start $ for end ,distinct,   Substr

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


######### Solution 1 MYSQL :
                                        SELECT DISTINCT(city)
                                        FROM station
                                        WHERE city REGEXP '^[aeiouAEIOU]' 
                                        AND city REGEXP '[aeiouAEIOU]$';

                                          [aeiouAEIOU] checks if the city name starts with a vowel (both lowercase and uppercase).
                                          [aeiouAEIOU]$ checks if the city name ends with a vowel (again, handling both cases).
                                          DISTINCT ensures that duplicate city names are removed.

                                            SELECT city
                                            FROM station
                                            WHERE lower(SUBSTR(city, 1, 1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u') AND
                                                 lower( SUBSTR (CITY,-1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');


                              SELECT city, SUBSTR(city, 1, 1), SUBSTR(city,-1)
                              FROM station;  // gives city name with first leeter and last letter
